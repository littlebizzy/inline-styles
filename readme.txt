#### The Long Version ####

Before the registered styles are processed, it checks the current queue and inspect for local styles, indistinctly for themes and plugins.

If so, then changes the mode that WP serves these styles, getting the file contents and setting it as an inline content, letting the whole process be managed by WP and keeping the same order the stylesheets are introduced.

Before to set the inline style content, it changes all the "url(.." references to absolute paths, so for convenience any URL must be referenced using the url() notation, which is the usual way.

Coming soon: support for fixing @import instances.

Google encourages inline <style>...</style> in the site-wide head to speed up above-the-fold rendering. They warn webmasters not to use massive inline styles as it might slow down your site, however, if your WordPress site is using a reasonable size CSS then it should be no problem. LittleBizzy.com has used this method for several years and seen a big improvement in loading speed and even SEO rankings (although due to various factors). PageSpeed Insights does not give our site warnings for "Prioritize Visible Content" meaning that Google thinks our inline CSS is a small enough size to be considered beneficial to overall loading speed. This plugin will work best on sites who have successfully considered their CSS code into a single style.css theme file.

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

#### Defined Constants ####

The following defined constants are supported by this plugin:

* `define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);`

#### Plugin Features ####

* Settings Page: No
* Premium Version Available: Yes ([Speed Demon](https://www.littlebizzy.com/plugins/speed-demon))

#### WP Admin Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first is a notice that fires during plugin activation which recommends several related free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear approximately once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear approximately once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel that these notices are too annoying, than we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the defined constant mentioned below inside of your `wp-config.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This defined constant will only affect the notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices that communicate with admin-level users.
